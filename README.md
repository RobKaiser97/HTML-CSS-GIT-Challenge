# <Horiseon-Refactoring-Homework-Assignment>

## Description

To practice newly learned skills within HTML and CSS, i set out with the objective of refactoring a previously designed website by the company, Horiseon.
Throughout the reworkoring of this page, multiple lines of redundant CSS code were removed. The original HTML code was altered to be in line with generally accepted Accessability 
standards and ensured the code followed a semantic format. This project helped me to better my knowledge of CSS and HTML.
